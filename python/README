Original source code for Python (2.6).

Please take into consideration the following, when using Spiral:
 1. Spiral is released under the GPL 2.0 license (you should have received a copy - in face i`m sure of it :P).
 2. Some algorithms are converted-based from Mat Buckland`s book "AI Techniques for Game Programming" [awesome book ;)]
 3. Some things are engineered as perceived from my perspective.
